    <p>
    If you want to use this module for extracting zip archives over 2GB, you will need to enter
    an executable command here that will be used for large zip files, because PHP does not support opening zip files over 2GB.
    </p>
    <p>
    The command should be the same as what you would call on the command line to unzip the archive.  In the place
    where you would put the path of the file to unzip on the command line, instead put <b>%zip</b>.  That will be
    substituted to the actual path of the zip file by Midas.  If your command also requires an unzip directory to be
    explicitly specified (rather than using the working directory), you must add <b>%dir</b> to the command where
    the output directory should be specified.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Example:</b> /usr/bin/unzip -o %zip
    </p>
    <p>
    Because that unzip executable uses the working directory by default, we do not need to specify <b>%dir</b>.
    DO NOT put quotes around the <b>%zip</b> or <b>%dir</b> arguments, Midas will do that automatically when it is expanded.
    The module will still work for zip files under 2GB if you leave this field blank.
