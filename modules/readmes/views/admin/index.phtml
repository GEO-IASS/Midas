        This module renders README files for communities and folders. The text of these files will be interpreted as
        <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> syntax and displayed on the info tab
        and below the hierarchical data view.
    </p>
    <p>
        For communities, place a file named README, README.txt, or README.md (case insensitive) at the root of the
        <i>Public</i> folder. For folders, place a similarly named file at the root of that folder.
