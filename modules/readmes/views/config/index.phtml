  <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
  <p>This module is intended to provide Readmes for communities as well as
      folders. The text of these readmes will be interpreted from

      syntax and display in the info tab as well as below the hierarchical
      data view.</p>
  <p>For communities, place a file named readme, readme.txt, or readme.md
      (case insensitive) at the root of the "Public" folder.</p>
  <p>For folders, place a similarly named file at the root of the folder in
      question.</p>
